# Chicken Coop Door Control
by Andrew Westfold. (c) April 2016

I don't like getting up at the crack of dawn just to let the chickens out so they can lay me nice fresh eggs!

So, I need some automated method of opening and closing their 'pop-hole' so they can get lots of natural daylight.

I had a bought system that did this, but after many years:
a. it broke, and 
b. the people that manufactured it went out of business.

So, time to design a small arduino-based system to do the job for me!

Requirements:
A method to automatically open or close the door.
- Timer controlled, but that means resetting the times as the year goes by (pain in the ****)
- Triggered by Light-level 

So, a light-level triggered arduino system that opens and shuts the door.
